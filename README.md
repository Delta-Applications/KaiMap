# delta.map
delta.map is a local offline and online caching client for viewing maps, weather, utilities, and more coming soon.
This is still a beta, a direct fork of o.map, uploaded by me on github after viewing some suggestions.

### Features
- Weather (OpenWeatherMap)
- Hardware Information (Connection, Battery, GPS)
- Maps (OpenTopoMap, OpenStreetMap, Satellite)
- Layers (OpenWeatherMap Precipitation, Temperature, etc.), All Layers are cached and weather layers usually display a date pointing out the time the data was acquired
